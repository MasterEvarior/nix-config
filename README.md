# ❄️ NixOS Configuration
[![Nix](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-Nix-5277C3.svg?style=flat-square&logo=NixOS&logoColor=white)](https://nixos.org)  
This is my NixOS configuration, which is highly inspired by [Imatpot](https://github.com/imatpot/dotfiles).

## How to use
1. Clone this repository onto your machine
2. Place the `configuration.template.nix` file into your `/etc/nixos` directory and rename it to `configuration.nix`. This may delete you exisiting `configuration.nix` file, so be sure to create a backup beforehand.
3. Replace `{hostname}` with one of the hosts in the `/hosts` directory.
4. Rebuild
5. ❄️❄️❄️ Bathe in the glory of NixOS ❄️❄️❄️
